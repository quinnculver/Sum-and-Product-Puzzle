# The following code solves the sum-product puzzle.
# Taken verbatim from
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_and_Product_Puzzle.

# X and Y are two different whole numbers greater than 1. Their sum is
# not greater than 100, and Y is greater than X. S and P are two
# mathematicians (and consequently perfect logicians); S knows the sum
# X + Y and P knows the product X Ã— Y. Both S and P know all the
# information in this paragraph.

# The following conversation occurs:

# S says "P does not know X and Y." (1)
# P says "Now I know X and Y." (2)
# S says "Now I also know X and Y." (3)
# What are X and Y?

# 
# Let S be the sum and P the product.

# (1) means that there is no way to write S as a sum of two
# primes. (Could it mean MORE?)

# (2) means that there is exactly one factorization WZ=P such that W+Z
# is not a sum of primes

# (3) means that there is only one way to write S as a sum of two
# numbers S = A+B such that the product AB has only one factorization
# RS=AB such that R+S is not a sum of primes

#Pseudocode
# For each possible sum s=3,4...100
#   If s is not a sum of two primes:
#     Initialize root labeled s of tree.
#     Create child (a,b) of s for each pair 1<a<b s.t. a+b = s.
#     For each factorization  wz=ab with 1<w<z:
#       If w+z<=100 and w+z not a sum of two primes:
#         Create child (w,z) of (a,b)
#   If there is exactly one node (a,b) with exactly one child (w,z):
#     s=a+b works!
